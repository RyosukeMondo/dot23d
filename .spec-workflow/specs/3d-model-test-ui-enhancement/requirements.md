# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current 3D Model Generation Test UI/UX serves as a comprehensive testing interface for the 3D model generation system, but suffers from poor user experience, inefficient workflows, and limited visual feedback. This enhancement aims to transform the testing interface into a modern, intuitive, and powerful tool that enables developers, QA engineers, and users to effectively test, validate, and optimize 3D model generation workflows.

The primary value proposition is to reduce testing time from hours to minutes through better automation, clearer visual feedback, and streamlined workflows while maintaining comprehensive test coverage and detailed reporting capabilities.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This enhancement aligns with the product's core mission of providing a robust 3D model generation pipeline by:
- Improving developer productivity through better testing tools
- Reducing time-to-market through faster validation cycles
- Ensuring quality through comprehensive automated testing
- Enabling easier debugging and optimization of the 3D generation process

5. WHEN the user reviews performance data THEN the system SHALL provide exportable reports in JSON and CSV formats

### Requirement 4: Advanced Parameter Testing Interface

**User Story:** As a QA engineer, I want an intuitive parameter testing interface with presets, bulk testing, and parameter sweep capabilities, so that I can systematically validate different generation scenarios without manual repetition.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses parameter controls THEN the system SHALL provide organized parameter groups with clear descriptions and valid ranges
2. IF the user selects a parameter preset THEN the system SHALL apply all parameters and show a summary of changes
3. WHEN the user wants to test multiple parameter combinations THEN the system SHALL provide bulk testing with parameter sweep functionality
4. WHEN invalid parameters are entered THEN the system SHALL provide immediate validation feedback with specific error descriptions
5. WHEN the user compares parameter combinations THEN the system SHALL display side-by-side comparisons with visual and performance differences

### Requirement 5: Interactive 3D Model Viewer Enhancements

**User Story:** As a user, I want an enhanced 3D viewer with better controls, measurement tools, and quality assessment features, so that I can thoroughly inspect generated models and verify their quality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user views a 3D model THEN the system SHALL provide smooth navigation controls (pan, zoom, rotate) with customizable sensitivity
2. IF the user wants to measure the model THEN the system SHALL provide measurement tools for dimensions, angles, and surface areas
3. WHEN the user inspects model quality THEN the system SHALL highlight potential issues (non-manifold geometry, duplicate vertices, etc.)
4. WHEN multiple models are generated THEN the system SHALL allow side-by-side comparison with synchronized camera controls
5. WHEN the user exports a model THEN the system SHALL provide format options (OBJ, STL, PLY) with quality settings

### Requirement 6: Comprehensive Test Results Dashboard

**User Story:** As a project manager or QA lead, I want a comprehensive dashboard showing test results, trends, and quality metrics, so that I can track project health and make informed decisions about releases.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user accesses the results dashboard THEN the system SHALL display test statistics, success rates, and performance trends
2. IF test failures occur THEN the system SHALL categorize failures by type and provide detailed error analysis
3. WHEN viewing test history THEN the system SHALL allow filtering by date range, pattern type, parameter sets, and success status
4. WHEN exporting test results THEN the system SHALL generate comprehensive reports in multiple formats (PDF, HTML, JSON)
5. WHEN critical issues are detected THEN the system SHALL highlight them prominently with actionable recommendations

### Requirement 7: Automated Test Workflows

**User Story:** As a DevOps engineer, I want automated test workflows that can run comprehensive test suites and generate reports, so that I can integrate 3D generation testing into CI/CD pipelines.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the user configures an automated test suite THEN the system SHALL allow defining test scenarios with expected outcomes
2. IF automated tests run THEN the system SHALL execute all test scenarios and generate pass/fail results with detailed logs

5. WHEN scheduled tests run THEN the system SHALL handle resource management and queue multiple test requests appropriately

### Requirement 8: Enhanced Error Handling and Debugging

**User Story:** As a developer, I want clear error messages, debugging information, and recovery suggestions when 3D generation fails, so that I can quickly diagnose and resolve issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria
