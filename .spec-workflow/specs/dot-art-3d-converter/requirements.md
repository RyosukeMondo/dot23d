# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Dot Art 3D Converter is a frontend-only web application that transforms monochrome dot art (pixel art) into downloadable 3D models suitable for 3D printing. The application allows users to upload dot art files (CSV format with true/false values), preview them with interactive controls, and convert them into 3D models (OBJ files) for 3D printing. The system also supports an advanced mode where users can upload regular images, convert them to dot art through resolution and threshold adjustments, and manually edit the dot pattern before 3D conversion.

## Alignment with Product Vision

This feature creates a bridge between digital pixel art and physical 3D printed objects, enabling artists and makers to bring their 2D creations into the physical world. The application democratizes 3D model creation by making it accessible to users without 3D modeling expertise.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1 - Basic Dot Art Upload and Conversion

**User Story:** As a pixel artist, I want to upload my dot art file and convert it to a 3D model, so that I can 3D print my digital artwork.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads a CSV file with true/false values THEN the system SHALL parse and display the dot art pattern
2. WHEN the dot art is displayed THEN the system SHALL provide pan and zoom controls for preview
3. WHEN a user clicks the download button THEN the system SHALL generate and download an OBJ file representing the 3D model

### Requirement 2 - Image to Dot Art Conversion

**User Story:** As a user without existing dot art files, I want to upload any image and convert it to dot art, so that I can create 3D models from my photos or drawings.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user uploads an image file THEN the system SHALL display resolution and threshold controls
2. WHEN a user adjusts resolution or threshold settings THEN the system SHALL update the dot art preview in real-time
3. WHEN the conversion parameters are set THEN the system SHALL generate a binary dot art representation

### Requirement 3 - Interactive Dot Art Editing

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually edit the dot pattern, so that I can refine the artwork before 3D conversion.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks on a dot in the preview THEN the system SHALL toggle its state (true/false)
2. WHEN a user makes a range selection THEN the system SHALL toggle all dots within the selected area
3. WHEN dots are modified THEN the system SHALL update the preview immediately

### Requirement 4 - 3D Model Generation Algorithm

**User Story:** As a system, I want to convert dot patterns into proper 3D models, so that the output is suitable for 3D printing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dot value is true THEN the system SHALL place a cube at that position
2. WHEN a dot value is false THEN the system SHALL leave empty space at that position
3. WHEN adjacent cubes share faces THEN the system SHALL merge those faces to optimize the model
4. WHEN generating the model THEN the system SHALL create a background layer one unit wider than the dot pattern to provide support structure

### Requirement 5 - Modular Development Pages

**User Story:** As a developer, I want separate pages for each core functionality, so that I can develop and test features independently before integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN developing THEN the system SHALL have separate pages: image loading, image-to-dot conversion, dot editing, and 3D model generation
2. WHEN each page is complete THEN the system SHALL integrate all functionality into a unified interface
3. WHEN testing individual features THEN each page SHALL work independently with its specific functionality

### Requirement 6 - GitHub Pages Deployment

**User Story:** As a project owner, I want the application deployed automatically, so that users can access it without local setup.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN code is pushed to the main branch THEN GitHub Actions SHALL build the React TypeScript application
2. WHEN the build succeeds THEN the system SHALL deploy to GitHub Pages automatically
3. WHEN deployed THEN the application SHALL be accessible via the GitHub Pages URL

## Non-Functional Requirements

### Code Architecture and Modularity
- **Single Responsibility Principle**: Each React component should handle one specific aspect (file upload, preview, editing, 3D generation)
- **Modular Design**: Separate utilities for CSV parsing, image processing, 3D mesh generation, and file download
- **Dependency Management**: Minimize external dependencies, prefer native browser APIs where possible
- **Clear Interfaces**: Define TypeScript interfaces for dot patterns, 3D models, and component props

### Performance
- **Image Processing**: Real-time preview updates during threshold/resolution adjustments
- **3D Generation**: Efficient mesh optimization for complex dot patterns
- **Memory Management**: Handle large images and complex 3D models without browser crashes
- **Responsive UI**: Smooth pan/zoom interactions with 60fps performance

### Security
- **File Validation**: Validate uploaded files (CSV format, image types) to prevent malicious uploads
- **Client-side Processing**: All operations performed in browser without server communication
- **Memory Safety**: Proper cleanup of canvas contexts and 3D rendering resources

### Reliability
- **Error Handling**: Graceful handling of invalid files, unsupported formats, and processing failures
- **Fallback Support**: Alternative download formats if OBJ generation fails
- **Browser Compatibility**: Support for modern browsers with WebGL and File API support

### Usability
- **Intuitive Interface**: Clear visual feedback for all user actions
- **Progressive Enhancement**: Basic functionality works without advanced browser features
- **Accessibility**: Keyboard navigation and screen reader support for core functions
- **Mobile Responsiveness**: Touch-friendly controls for mobile devices
